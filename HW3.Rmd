# 4.7

``` {r, include = FALSE}
library(alr4)
attach(UN11)
```
```{r}
lm(log(fertility)~(log(ppgdp)+lifeExpF))
print(100 * (exp(log(1.25) * -0.06544) - 1))
```
This value corrospond with a 1.4% decrease in expected fertility.

# 4.8
The mean function is linear when the mean of x2 is y0 +y1 * x1 \newline
3 + 4x1 + 2(y0 + y1 * x1) \newline
3 + y0 + (4 + 2y1) * x1 \newline
So the coefficient will be negative when y1 < -2

# 4.9
## 4.9.1
The coefficient of Sex tells us that females earn \$3340
less than males. \newline
The intercept tells us that males make \$24697 

## 4.9.2
This would be the case if females work longer than males.
